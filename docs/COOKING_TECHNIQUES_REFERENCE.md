## How It Works

When you write a recipe step like:
- "Dice the onions and mince the garlic"
- "Whisk eggs until fluffy"
- "Sear the steak on high heat"

The system automatically:
1. ✅ Detects the cooking techniques (dice, mince, whisk, sear)
2. ✅ Matches synonyms ("cube" → "dice", "finely chop" → "mince")
3. ✅ Shows real images of hands performing each technique
4. ✅ Adds proper attribution to photographers
